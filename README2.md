Stoic Quote Project

Project Description
For my project, I am going to create my own json of stoic quotes which allows a user to view
a list of quotes and be able to add their favorite quotes to a Top 5 list. This will work by hovering over a quote and
pressing a number key corresponding to which postion the user wants the quote to be added to.
The user will also be able to add their own stoic quotes to the json through a form on the top right of the screen.
When the user come across a keyword in a quote they are able to highlight that word or words by selecting them and right clicking on their mouse. 
For the iteration portion, I will be using the forEach to display all my quotes on to the screen. 
Lastly, the object and attribute portion, I plan for each quote being its own object with the 3 attributes being: the quote, author, the source.

Event Listeners
- The user can add their own quote to the json - 'submit'
- When selecting a word in the document, you can right click and the words will be highlighted - 'contextmenu'
- When you 'click' a highlighted word in the quote it toggles off the highlighted portion - 'click'
- When you press a number key 1-5 it adds the quote you are hovering over to a Top 5 list - 'keydown'
