Stoic Quote Project

Project Description
For my project, I am going to use stoic quote API which allows a user to view
a list of quotes and be able to add their favorite quotes to a Top 10 list. 
They will also be able to add their own stoic quotes to the API and when they come
across a keyword in a quote they are able to highlight that word. For the iteration portion,
I want to be able to see how many words/characters are in each quote. To fulfill the object and attribute portion, I plan for each quote being its own object with the 3 attributes being: the quote, author, the author's birthday/where the quote was said/cite the source (Not sure about the third one if you have a recommendation, I would appreciate it)
(I can also filter through each author to see how many quotes each person has in the API.)
Event Listeners
- The user can add their own quote to the API - submit
- When you 'click' a word in the quote it will highlight it - click
- When you press a number key 0-9 it adds the quote to a Top 10 list -key down

API

Challenges
One challenge I expect is when a word is clicked, only the individual word is highlighted and not the entire quote.
The hardest challenge I expect is only showing one quote at a time and being able to move to the next quote unless it's displayed as a list of quotes
Another challenge will be hitting the number key and putting the quote where it needs to go on the Top 10 list.Overall, I think playing with the API portion will be the most difficult and beneficial to growing my coding experience as I struggled to wrap my head around how API work and function so it'll be nice to have so much more experience under my belt.
