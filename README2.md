Stoic Quote Project

Project Description
For my project, I am going to create my own json of stoicquotes which allows a user to view
a list of quotes and be able to add their favorite quotes to a Top 5 list. 
They will also be able to add their own stoic quotes to the json and when they come
across a keyword in a quote they are able to highlight that word. For the iteration portion,
I will be using the forEach to display all my quotes on to the screen. To fulfill the object and attribute portion, I plan for each quote being its own object with the 3 attributes being: the quote, author, the source.

Event Listeners
- The user can add their own quote to the json - 'submit'
- When selecting a word in the document, you can right click and the words will be highlighted - 'contextmenu'
- When you 'click' a highlighted word in the quote it will unhighlight it - 'click'
- When you press a number key 1-5 it adds the quote you are hovering over to a Top 5 list - 'key down'
